# 🩺 Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Risk Prediction App

This project was developed as part of my **MSc Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** dissertation at the **University of East London**.  
It predicts **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)** risk using **lifestyle and anthropometric data** from the **NHANES 2017–2018** dataset.

The app was **built and deployed entirely on Hugging Face Spaces**, demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to develop accessible, interpretable tools that support early identification of NAFLD risk through non-invasive data.

## 🚀 **App Overview**
- **Purpose:** Predict the likelihood of NAFLD using lifestyle and body composition variables.  
- **Dataset:** NHANES 2017–2018 (U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey).  
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).  
- **Platform:** Hugging Face Spaces (Python-based ML app).  
- **Goal:** Provide a simple, user-friendly web application to demonstrate AI-driven NAFLD risk prediction.

## 🧠 **Project Objectives**
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM) to estimate NAFLD risk.  
- Use lifestyle and anthropometric features to create an interpretable, low-cost predictive framework.  
- Deploy a fully functional web app on Hugging Face Spaces for public use and demonstration.
